# Telephone Directory Application

This is a simple C++ console-based application that simulates a telephone directory. The application allows you to manage contacts by adding, searching, displaying, deleting, and saving them to or loading them from a file.

## Features

- **Add Person Contact**: Add a new personal contact with a name, phone number, and address.
- **Add Business Contact**: Add a new business contact with a name, phone number, and company name.
- **Search Contact**: Search for a contact by name and view their details.
- **Display Contacts**: Display all contacts in the directory.
- **Delete Contact**: Delete a contact by name.
- **Save Contacts to File**: Save all contacts to a file for persistence.
- **Load Contacts from File**: Load contacts from a file to restore previous data.

## Classes and Design

- **Contact (Abstract Base Class)**: 
  - Represents a general contact with a name and phone number.
  - Pure virtual function `display()` to ensure derived classes implement it.

- **Person (Derived Class)**:
  - Inherits from `Contact`.
  - Adds an address attribute.
  - Overrides the `display()` function to show the contact's details.

- **Business (Derived Class)**:
  - Inherits from `Contact`.
  - Adds a company name attribute.
  - Overrides the `display()` function to show the contact's details.

- **TelephoneDirectory**:
  - Manages a collection of `Contact` objects using a `map` data structure.
  - Provides methods to add, search, display, delete, save, and load contacts.
